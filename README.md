### Hi there
I'm Mickey Xu 徐美琦, a postgraduate student majored in English translation at Southwest Petroleum University in Sichuan, China.
I have a cat named Hanhan, a 5-year-old British shorthair.
I am currently learning technical communication and want to become a technical writer upon graduation.
